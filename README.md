The program accepts a temperature value from the user and then asks the user for a second value (1 or 0), which determines whether the initial value was farenheight or celsius. From here, depending on the users seconds input, it converts the temperature value to either farenheight or celsius.

We chose the MIT liscence because it gives users express permission to reuse code for any purpose, sometimes even if code is part of proprietary software.
We chose the Contributor Covenant code of conduct because it helps make the community's values more explicit.
